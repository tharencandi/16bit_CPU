Git Workflow
- Assign oneself to "Issue" (see Issues repo page) detailing change needed.
- Update local repo to match master. git pull origin master
- Create and switch to new branch. git checkout -b <branch_name>
- Make changes.
- Look at the files that you have changed. git status
- Stage changes. git add <file_that_has_been_changed>
- Commit changes with meaningful message. git commit -m <commit_message>
- Push to remote repository. git push -u origin <branch_name>
- Create pull request when ready to merge changes to master branch and link it to relevant issue.
- At least 1 other team member reviews the pull request. they either suggest change. or approve the pull request and merge to master.
- Delete branch once changes has been merged into master if it is not going to be reused.
- Done.
